# BlackjackProject

# Description
For this assignment, we were asked to create a simplified version of the blackjack game. In our program, we needed to create several classes to replicate what would happen at a real blackjack table. We needed to design and implement code which would allow a user to play a hand by receiving two cards from a deck class. The user is then prompted to hit or stand. The user is able to hit as many times as they want until they go over the limit of 21. Should the user stand, the program will move on to the dealer who will collect cards if they have < 17 points but not greater than 21. In my program, I then called a method to compare the value of the dealers hand and the users hand in order to determine a winner, at which time the user is asked if they want to play again.

# Lessons Learned
In this lesson, I learned more deeply the subtle art of Object Oriented Programming. I furthered my knowledge on calling non-static methods in other classes while not instantiating a new public object to do so. I also learned more about how to create and store Lists in various classes and then use that structure in other classes, abstract or not. Overall, this was a very good lesson in trial and error programming for me and just how useful creating methods and classes with meaningful and understandable names is.
